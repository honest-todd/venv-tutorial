# Python Virtual Environments
### _If you are a frequent Python user you have likely encountered issues handling package dependancies. Luckily virtual environment allow users to manage multiple combinations of packages without affecting the main global instillation. In this tutorial you will learn how to create and manage differnet environments with the lightweight package `venv`._ 
#
# Instructions
## 1. Make sure Python is installed
* Use command `Python --version` to determine which Python version is installed on your local device

## 8. Install a package
* install any packages in your new environment.
* use `pip` or `pip3 install` if using Python3.
